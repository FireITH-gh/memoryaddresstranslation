# Address Translation
This is a C++ program that implements a map to translate user-given logical addresses into page numbers/offsets and physical addresses.
To execute: you will need to compile and run the translation.cpp file using a C++ compiler

Instructions: The program will ask the user to input a logical address in hexadecimal. After entering the address, the program will translate the address into page number, offset, and physical address, and then display these to the user. The program will then ask the user to enter another logical address. The user can quit at any time by entering -1.
